## Risk Tolerance

A project aimed at building a model that would be able to estimate the real risk tolerance of an investor. The algorithm used is a random forest with R2 score at the level of 0.9636, and the data used for forecasting is Survey of Consumer Finances 2007 - 2009 (before and after the financial crisis). The model calculates the "estimated risk tolerance", which should be understood as the ratio of risky assets (shares, stocks, corporate bonds) to the value of the entire investment portfolio.
